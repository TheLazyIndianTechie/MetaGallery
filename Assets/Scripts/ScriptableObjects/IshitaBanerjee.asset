  artistBio: "Ishita is the creator of the Mad Men Modern world of Soul Curry. Artist,
    dreamer, poet and color addict, her art is conceived and created from my home
    studio in Montreal, Canada. Through her pieces, she weaves a story of people,
    of time and of the human relationship of the earth, nature and its dwellers.\\n\\nIshita's
    artworks reside at the intersection of moods, feelings, nature, abstraction and
    colors. From mid-century modern inspired art, bold colorful abstracts, or dramatic
    & rich Cubist faces, her art is modern, media is mixed and style is continuously
    evolving. Organic lines and marks weave through her art, marking the passage
    of time, of feelings, emotions, memories and associations. The juxtaposition
    of visual and sensory experiences that is visceral in its simplicity and exuberant
    in its joy, lending color to the narrative of the life and heart of the homes
    it resides in. Through Soul Curry Art, Ishita strives to give tangible forms
    to complex emotions like grief, longing, loss, love, suffering. The interplay
    of human relationships, whether with one\u2019s own self or with others is a
    recurrent theme in the pieces she makes.\\n\\nIshita's NFTs are carefully crafted,
    by hand, using traditional art techniques like pen, ink, acrylic, gouache, photography,
    collage on paper and canvas to digital native artworks drawn using the iPad on
    Procreate in 4K and 8K resolution. "
