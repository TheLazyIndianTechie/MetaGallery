  artistBio: Carmilla Sumantry is a multidisciplinary artist and designer based in
    Vancouver, Canada. As a creative jack of all trades and trained as an industrial
    designer, she carries experience in a variety of fields and mediums; including
    furniture design, graphic design, oil painting, and digital art.\n\nForever gravitating
    towards the intersection of art and design, a pivot into the NFT art world was
    a natural transition. In early 2021, she began publishing and selling 1/1 3D
    animated artwork as NFTs. This body of work is representative of surrealist dream-states
    and translations of escapism, informed by design and colour theory. Each piece
    is an expression of personal growth, existential thought, and mindful interpersonal
    connection; with an intent grounded in spiritual awareness.\n\nThis new medium
    led to several collaboration, consulting, and community-building opportunities;
    as well as an enlightened passion for the potential culture-shifting power of
    the web3 space. Carmilla plans to continue building a diverse career as an independent
    creative in web3 and beyond. Say hi and get in touch with your creative needs
    and collaboration opportunities.
